                The Department of Wildlife Conservation conserves the biodiversity of Sri Lanka. Every individual species is provided legal protection through the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No 2 of 1937.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Habitats and the associated biodiversity are protected through a network of Protected Areas.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                International Trade of Wild Species are regulated both using the provisions of Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and the Provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Within the first decade, cadre of the department was gradually expanded and deployed to protect the wildlife protected areas in the country. New wildlife Protected Areas in the Gal Oya basin and the Yala Block II also were declared.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Most significant step taken within this period was the appointment of a committee for the protection of the wildlife in 1957. Subsequently, recommendations of this committee on wildlife protected area development, establishment of new protected areas, amendment of Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance with special reference to wild elephants, establishment of corridors, improvement of organisation of Wildlife Department gave rise to a notable progress in those fields.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The challenge in the hands of the Department of Wildlife Conservation from 1960 onwards was to ensure the protection of wildlife resources against the large scale multi-purpose development projects implemented in the country. A string of wildlife protected areas was established in the Mahaweli region, with the objective of providing shelter for the wild animal populations, especially the wild elephants, displaced due to large scale forest clearings under the accelerated Mahaweli Development Project. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided financial assistance through a special project titled Mahaweli Environmental Project (MEP), for the establishment and development of these protected areas.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Since 1993, a special project was launched under the title of “Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected Area Management”, within the Department. Under this project, funded by UNDP/FAO through Global Environmental Facility (GEF), long term management plans were prepared for all leading wildlife protected areas and an intensive human resource development program was implemented. Increase of the departmental cadre, research on wildlife, production of public educational materials, formulation of a wild elephant conservation strategy, were the other outcomes of this project, which concluded by the end of 1999.
